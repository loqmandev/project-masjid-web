1. Brand Essence (At the Core)
What is JejakMasjid?

JejakMasjid is a personal journey of presence.
It helps Muslims gently track, remember, and continue their visits to masjids — not as a competition, but as a quiet record of intention.

JejakMasjid does not ask:

“Where is the nearest masjid?”

It asks:

“Where have you been, and where might you go next?”

One-sentence definition

JejakMasjid is an app that records your footsteps to masjids, turning small visits into a meaningful personal journey.

2. The Problem We Are Addressing (Subtle, Real)

Many Muslims:

only visit one or two familiar masjids

pass by masjids without stopping

don’t feel motivated to explore beyond routine

lack a sense of continuity in their spiritual journey

Not because they don’t care —
but because daily life is loud, and intention is quiet.

JejakMasjid exists to make intention visible.

3. The Goal (What Success Looks Like)
Primary Goal

To encourage more frequent, mindful visits to masjids in daily life.

Secondary Goals

Help users feel connected to the wider ummah

Encourage exploration beyond one’s usual masjid

Create a personal, non-judgmental record of spiritual presence

Enable small contributions (photos, info, care) to masjid communities

Success is not measured by virality or addiction.

Success is when:

Someone “singgah” at a masjid they would have otherwise passed by.

4. Mission Statement

To gently guide Muslims towards a masjid-centred life,
one visit at a time,
without pressure, comparison, or noise.

5. Core Values (Non-Negotiable)

These values should guide every design, feature, and copy decision.

1. Sincerity (Ikhlas)

No shaming

No guilt-based messaging

No “streak panic”

The app should feel like a journal, not a scoreboard.

2. Presence Over Performance

Being there matters more than how long

A short visit still counts

Quality of intention > quantity of visits

3. Gentle Motivation

Achievements exist to encourage, not to rank worth

Language must be soft, not competitive

Avoid “you should” tone

4. Personal Journey

Progress is personal

Leaderboards are optional and secondary

The main story is between the user and their own path

5. Respect for the Masjid

Masjids are not “checkpoints”

Avoid gamification that feels disrespectful

Visuals and language must maintain adab

6. Brand Personality (How JejakMasjid Feels)

If JejakMasjid were a person, it would be:

calm

thoughtful

quietly encouraging

never loud

never judgmental

present, not performative

Tone keywords

tenang

bersahaja

ikhlas

mengajak, bukan memaksa

7. Language & Copy Guidelines
Preferred language

Bahasa Melayu (primary)

English (secondary, simple)

Copy rules

Short sentences

Warm phrasing

Avoid corporate language

Avoid slang that ages badly

Good examples

“Singgah sebentar?”

“Langkah kecil, jejak yang bermakna.”

“Terima kasih kerana hadir.”

Avoid

“Complete now!”

“Don’t miss your streak!”

“Top users today!”

8. Naming Philosophy (Achievements, Features, Screens)

Names should feel:

reflective

dignified

meaningful without being heavy

Achievement naming style

Use words related to:

journey (langkah, jejak, safar)

presence (hadir, singgah)

continuity (teruskan, istiqamah)

Avoid:

gaming terms (XP, level up, grind)

aggressive competition terms

9. Visual & Logo Direction
Logo should feel:

simple

timeless

respectful

not “techy”

Visual inspiration

location

paths

subtle markers

lines instead of shapes

space and breathing room

Avoid:

bright neon colours

cartoon mascots

aggressive gradients

overly playful icons

10. What JejakMasjid Is NOT

This is important for future decisions.

JejakMasjid is NOT:

a replacement for Google Maps

a social media platform

a productivity tracker

a religious authority

a competitive leaderboard app

If a feature pulls JejakMasjid towards any of the above, it likely doesn’t belong.

11. Long-term Vision (Without Pressure)

JejakMasjid is allowed to:

remain small

serve a niche

grow slowly

exist quietly

Its value is not in scale alone, but in meaning per user.

12. Closing Statement (Anchor)

JejakMasjid exists to remember where we have been,
so we may choose where to go next — with intention.
